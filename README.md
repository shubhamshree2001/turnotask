## üöÄ **Setup & Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-task-manager-app.git
   cd your-task-manager-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Platform-specific setup:**

    - **iOS:**
        - Add notification permissions to `Info.plist`.
        - Ensure Push Notifications capability is enabled.
        - Test on a real device for haptic feedback.

    - **Android:**
        - Configure `AndroidManifest.xml` for notification and boot permissions:
          ```xml
          <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
          <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
          ```
        - Add required broadcast receivers for persistent notifications.
        - Test on a real device for notification actions.

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Platform-Specific Implementations**

- **Notifications:**
    - iOS: Uses `flutter_local_notifications` with iOS-specific configurations for custom alerts and haptics.
    - Android: Uses `flutter_local_notifications` with action buttons and boot persistence using `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`.

- **Date & Time Pickers:**
    - Uses `showDatePicker` and `showTimePicker` with platform-specific styling.

- **Haptic Feedback:**
    - iOS-specific haptics using `HapticFeedback` API.

- **Dark Mode:**
    - Uses `ThemeMode.system` to adapt to system-wide theme changes.

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è **Challenges & Trade-offs**

- Handling **persistent notifications** on Android required setting up boot receivers and ensuring proper background execution, which can vary by device manufacturers.
- Ensuring **consistent behavior** across iOS and Android for notification actions and haptics took extra testing time.
- Recurring tasks required additional logic to re-schedule notifications accurately.
- iOS notification action buttons are more limited than Android‚Äôs.

---

## ‚úÖ **Testing Notes**

- Tested on:
    - **iOS Simulator:** Limited notification and haptic testing. Final tests done on real devices.
    - **Android Emulator:** Works for scheduling and viewing notifications. Real device tests verified boot persistence and action buttons.
- Recommended:
    - Always test **notifications and haptics on real devices** for best accuracy.
    - Check dark mode on both system themes.
